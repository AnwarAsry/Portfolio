                I have experience working with various technologies, including React,
                TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy collaborating with designers and
                backend developers to create seamless user experiences.

                In my free time, I love exploring new technologies, contributing to
                open-source projects, and sharing my knowledge with the developer
                community.
