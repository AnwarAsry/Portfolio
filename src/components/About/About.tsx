                    Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anwar Asry, a passionate frontend developer with a knack for bringing designs to life and crafting seamless user experiences.
                    Whether it's designing pixel-perfect interfaces, optimizing performance, or experimenting with the latest web technologies,
                    I'm all about creating solutions that look great and work even better.
                    <br /><br />
                    When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring design trends, sipping on a refreshing cup of mint tea,
                    or diving into my next creative side project. Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€
                </p>
